          <h2>SECTION 1 - THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT</h2>
          <div>Registration Information</div>
          <p>We obtain information you provide directly when you optionally register as a member of the Services. Registration with us is required to be able to use some, but not all, features of the Services. When registration is required, you will be prompted to log in or to create an account, if you have not already done so. When you register with us and use the Services, you are asked to provide the following information: name, email address, mobile number, username and password.</p>
          <div>Social Networking Sites</div>
          <p>Our Services include interfaces that expedite the registration process by allowing you to connect with social networking sites (each a “SNS”). If a user connects to a SNS through our Services, the user authorizes us to access, use and store the information that you agreed the SNS could provide to us based on your settings on that SNS. We will access, use and store that information in accordance with this Policy. You can revoke our access to the information you provide in this way at any time by amending the appropriate settings from within your account settings on the applicable SNS.</p>
          <div>Customer Service</div>
          <p>If you contact us directly, such as to request information or for customer support, we may receive additional information about you, such as your contact information and the contents of your communication. We may also receive information from you when you complete a form on our Services.</p>
          <div>Device, Technical, and Usage Information</div>
          <p>In order to provide the features available in the Services we also collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to, the type of devices you use, your device’s unique device IDs where available or set, the IP address of your device, your operating system, the type of browsers you use, how you engage with websites you visit while using the Services, non-personal data extracted from third party websites, and information about the way you use the Services, such as your searches and when you click on a button to take certain actions using the Services. Where possible we work to make settings available to you as a member to control which features are available and the information required for us to provide each. oOhCoupons.com does not track your search engine history, emails or browsing on non-retail sites.</p>
          <div>Information Collection Technologies</div>
          <p>When you use the Services, we and our third party service providers may collect information from you through cookies, web beacons, web server logs, and similar technologies. A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer or mobile device. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. By using the Services, our users consent to the placement of cookies, beacons, and similar technologies in your browser and on emails in accordance with this Policy. If you disable cookies on your browser, some parts of the Services may not work fully. It should be noted that we partner with third parties to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on our website and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. Some of our advertising partners are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance. If you do not wish to receive our personalized ads, please visit their opt-out pages to learn about how you may opt out of receiving personalized ads from member companies. Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>

          <p>oOhCoupons.com uses a variety of physical, managerial, and technical safeguards designed to improve the security of our systems and your personally identifiable information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to oOhCoupons.com, nor can we guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

We do not allow them to use such information for any other purpose. If oOhCoupons.com learns of a security systems breach, then we will attempt to notify you so that you can take appropriate protective steps.</p>
          <p>We take measures to delete your personal information or keep it in a form that does not permit identifying you when this information is no longer necessary for the purposes for which we process it, unless we are required by law to keep this information for a longer period or such information is necessary to resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. When determining the retention period, we take into account various criteria, such as the type of products and services requested by or provided to you, the nature and length of our relationship with you, possible re-enrollment with our Services, the impact on the Services if we delete some information from or about you, mandatory retention periods provided by law and the statute of limitations.</p>
